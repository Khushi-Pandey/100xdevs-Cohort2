<!-- 1. STATE: An object that represents the current state of the app. It represents the dynamic things in your app(things that change) for ex, the value of the counter {counter: 1} -->

<!-- 2. COMPONENT: How a DOM element should render, given a state. It is a re-usable, dynamic, HTML snippet that changes given the state. ex, linkedin's no. of notifications/messages -->

<!-- 3. RE-RENDERING: A state change triggers a re-render.
A re-render represents the actual DOM being manipulated
when the state changes -->

<!-- You usually have to define all your components once
And then all you have to do is update the state of your app, React takes care of re-rendering your app
