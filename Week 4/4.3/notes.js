// Mongo deep dive

// database -> It is a place where data is stored persistently.
// http servers are transient

// ORM : basically the library to talk to a database. ex- prisma, mongoose

// In Mongoose first you have to define a schema

// MongoDB(schema less) is in stark contrast with SQL databases(which are schema based, you have to upfront tell the structure of your data)
