// DOM : Document Object Model
// A standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.
// JavaScript makes the HTML page active and dynamic via the DOM

// The DOM is a tree-like representation of the webpage and represents the document as nodes and objects
// It is language independent. It's not a part of JavaScript language.
